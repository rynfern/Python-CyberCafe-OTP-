# Python-CyberCafe-OTP-

This project is a realistic recreation of a menu screen from a real cyber cafe where users
must log in and create new accounts. Additionally, once an account is created, it is saved
in the database and the user can access it from any computer at any time. After logging
in, the user will be required to select the duration of time he would like to spend on the in
the cyber cafe and pay accordingly. This programme contains a payment section where
The user will be.given the chapter code that was produced at random to confirm that he is
a human, not a robot. In order for the verification process to proceed, the user will also
need to input his Gmail ID. He will receive an OTP in real time to that ID, which he must
enter correctly.
